# Events / _Phaneros_

The Phaneros project aims to fundamentally rethink and reimagine how observability events are
captured, collected, and communicated within high- and low-latency computing environments. The
primary objective of this project is to offer a simplified but highly versatile instrumentation
interface that affords efficient and effective contextualization of emitted phenomenon states within
application and runtime system spaces.
